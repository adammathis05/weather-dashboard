# weather-dashboard

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I wanted to create a dashboard with a search bar that could take a city name as input, store it in local storage, and return both the current weather and 5-day forecast for that city. I was able to pull the API and get the accurate current weather data working from the search bar, but need to add weather forecasting and CSS elements to improve the UI. This exercise was a good opportunity to practice using DOM elements and dayjs. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
